It seems I am representing my school at ICPC. I am also learning other things,
such as how I may be shit and egotistical, a pleasent conversation. The first
practice has traumatized me in my attempt to be number 9 in the world to
solve a problem. 

I wanna win the mid-atlantic with my funny party school.
