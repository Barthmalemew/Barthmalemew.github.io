So far internship season is a bust, everyone I know myself included got nepotism internships.
When I do get to a technical interview its easy, but it does seem like the resume is all that
truly matters. Ironically I have no trouble getting contract work and accidently applying for SE jobs.
The interviewers have different goals it seems, Internships wanna make you into the solution for
a problem they dont have yet, so have TOO many skills hurts. Meanwhile, Software Engineers know what 
the problem is and need someone with those skills asap. At least I seem to have gotten one, 
although it is using PHP, I love the langauge and regret not learning it sooner its so much fun to
mess with, I made a goldfish face when I saw "php -s" thats nuts. Scared to see what mess exists
in their code base though, gotta get good fast for this one.

I Miss naps.
